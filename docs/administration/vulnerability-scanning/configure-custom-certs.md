title: Configure custom Certification Authorities for trivy
weight: 55
---

In some cases it might be usefull to provide custom certificate auhtority (CA) bundles to trivy. This is often the case if you are in an enterprise environment where a webproxy is used. Because trivy must connect to the internet to get the CVE data, it must pass the proxy. Trivy reads certificates from a bind-mount, thus it is possible to place certificates in this folder and trivy will validate against them, if new connections are created.

## Preparation
- You have a ca-bundle, or single public certificates of your CA, which is used by the webproxy.

## Implementation
1. Change into your harbor configuration folder
1. Take a look at the docker-compose.yml and the configuration of trivy-adapter. It looks something like this:
```yaml
  trivy-adapter:
    container_name: trivy-adapter
    image: goharbor/trivy-adapter-photon:dev
    restart: always
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    dns_search: .
    depends_on:
      - log
      - redis
    networks:
      - harbor
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /data/trivy-adapter/trivy
        target: /home/scanner/.cache/trivy
      - type: bind
        source: /data/trivy-adapter/reports
        target: /home/scanner/.cache/reports
      - type: bind
        source: ./common/config/shared/trust-certificates
        target: /harbor_cust_cert
```
1. note the binding which mounts to `/harbor_cust_cert` and add your ca-bundle or the single public-certificates into the mount-location, by copying them.
1. (opt) if the host-path doesn't fit for your case, you can also configure another path in the docker-compose file. be aware, that you might have to manually change this, if there are changes on new releases of trivy/harbor.
1. restart your containers (at least trivy-adapter) by using `docker restart trivy-adapter` or `docker compose restart`. If you changed the bind path, it is necessary to start the services by using `docker compose up -d`

## Upgrades
Depending on if you changed the path or not an update might overwrite the folder or mount from a different location. The following process makes sure, you don't run into anything unexpected
1. backup your certificates to a folder, which is unrelated to harbor-configuration
1. upgrade harbor as always
1. check if the `/harbor_cust_cert` mount is the same as the folder where your certificates reside (normally `./common/config/shared/trust-certificates`)
1. check if the folder still holds your certificates, otherwise copy your backuped certificates to the location
1. check if trivy is able to get CVE data
