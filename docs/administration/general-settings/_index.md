You can configure Harbor to set the registry in read-only mode, and configure Harbor so that only system administrators can create projects.

## Make the Registry Read Only

You can set Harbor to read-only mode. In read-only mode, Harbor allows `docker pull` but prevents `docker push` and the deletion of repositories and tags.

If it set to true, deleting repositories, tags and pushing images are not permitted.

```sh
docker push 10.117.169.182/demo/ubuntu:14.04
The push refers to a repository [10.117.169.182/demo/ubuntu]
0271b8eebde3: Preparing 
denied: The system is in read only mode. Any modification is prohibited.
```

## Set Who Can Create Projects

Use the **Project Creation** drop-down menu to set which users can create projects. Select **Everyone** to allow all users to create projects. Select **Admin Only** to allow only users with the Harbor system administrator role to create projects.

## Retain image last pull time on scanning

By default, a vulnerability scanner(e.g. Trivy) will update the image's last `pull time` when the image is scanned. This affects the **Tag Retention Rules** based on pull time. If you want to eliminate this effect, you can enable this option to avoid updating the pull time on scanning.
