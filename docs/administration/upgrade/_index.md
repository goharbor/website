If you are upgrading a Harbor instance that you deployed with Helm, see [Upgrading Harbor Deployed with Helm](helm-upgrade.md).

When upgrading an existing Harbor instance to a newer version, you might need to migrate the settings in `harbor.yml`.
Since the migration might alter the database schema and the settings of `harbor.yml`, you should **always** back up your data before any migration.

## Important Upgrade Notes

- Again, you MUST backup your data before any data migration.
- In Harbor v2.9, if you are using an external database, make sure the version of PostgreSQL >= 12.

## Upgrading Harbor and Migrating Data

1. Log in to the Harbor host and, if it is still running, stop and remove the existing Harbor instance.

    ```sh
    cd harbor
    docker-compose down
    ```

1. Back up Harbor's current files so that you can roll back to the current version if necessary.

    ```sh
    mv harbor /my_backup_dir/harbor
    ```

1. Back up the database, which by default is in the directory `/data/database`.

    ```sh
    cp -r /data/database /my_backup_dir/
    ```

1. Get the latest Harbor release package from [https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases) and extract it.

   For more information see [Download the Harbor Installer](../../install-config/download-installer.md).

1. Before upgrading Harbor, perform migration.

    The migration tool is in harbor-prepare tools delivered as a docker image. You can pull the image from docker hub. in the following command:

    ```sh
    docker pull goharbor/prepare:[tag]
    ```

    Alternatively, if you are using an offline installer package, you can load it from the image tarball that is included in the offline installer package. Replace [tag] with the new Harbor version, for example v1.10.0, in the following command:

    ```sh
    tar zxf <offline package>
    docker image load -i harbor/harbor.[version].tar.gz
    ```

1. Copy the `/path/to/old/harbor.yml` to `harbor.yml` and upgrade it.

    ```sh
    docker run -it --rm -v /:/hostfs goharbor/prepare:[tag] migrate -i ${path to harbor.yml}
    ```

    **NOTE:** The schema upgrade and data migration of the database is performed by core when Harbor starts. If the migration fails, check the core log to debug.

1. In the `./harbor` directory, run the `./install.sh` script to install the new Harbor instance.

   To install Harbor with Trivy, see [Run the Installer Script](../../install-config/run-installer-script.md) for more information.

If you need to roll back to the previous version of Harbor, see [Roll Back from an Upgrade](roll-back-upgrade.md).
