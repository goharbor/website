## Want to contribute to the codebase or documentation?

If you’re a newcomer, check out the “[Good first issue][good-first]” and “[Help wanted][help-wanted]” labels in the Harbor repository.

If you are ready to jump in and test, add code, or help with documentation, follow the instructions on our [contributing][contributing] documentation for guidance on how to setup Harbor for development.

You can follow the work we plan to do using the [Harbor Roadmap][roadmap] and see our milestones on our [project board][projectboard]. You can also follow the state of all issues and our backlog on the [ZenHub][zenhub] board.
