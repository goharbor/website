# Harbor CLI Encryption Guide

This document provides an overview of how Harbor CLI encrypts sensitive data and offers recommendations for different runtime environments.

## Overview of Encryption
Harbor CLI secures credentials using AES-GCM encryption. An encryption key is automatically generated and stored in one of several keyring backends, depending on your environment:

1. **Environment-based Keyring**  
2. **System Keyring**  
3. **File-based Keyring (Fallback)**

### How It Works
1. **Key Retrieval**  
    The CLI checks if an encryption key already exists.  
    If not present, Harbor CLI generates a new 32-byte key.
2. **Encrypt**  
    Harbor CLI uses AES-GCM to encrypt credentials with a random nonce.  
    The CLI stores ciphertext as a Base64-encoded string.
3. **Decrypt**  
    Harbor CLI decodes and decrypts the stored ciphertext whenever credentials are needed.

## Recommended Backends
### Desktop Environments
**Use the system keyring** if available. This is the most secure method, as most desktop operating systems keep secrets confidentially within their native keyring service.

### Docker / Kubernetes Environments
**Use the environment-based keyring** in production. System keyrings typically aren’t available in Docker or Kubernetes. Supplying encryption keys as environment variables or secrets is straightforward.

#### Example: Running Harbor CLI in Docker
Use a randomly generated key as an environment variable:
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e HARBOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  registry.goharbor.io/harbor-cli/harbor-cli \
  login https://demo.goharbor.io -u username -p password
```

#### Example: Running Harbor CLI in Kubernetes
Use a randomly generated key / strong password and store in a kubernetes secret. Pass the secret content as an environment variable to the deployment pod:
```yaml
# secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: harbor-cli-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  HARBOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY: "<base64-encoded-key>"

# deployment.yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: harbor-cli
    image: registry.goharbor.io/harbor-cli/harbor-cli
    envFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: harbor-cli-secrets
```

### File-based Keyring (Fallback)

In environments where neither a system keyring nor environment-based keyring is available, Harbor CLI can store the encryption key in a file. By default, this file-based keyring is located at `~/.harbor/keyring`. The stored key is protected by file permissions set to allow only the owner to read or write the file. However, **this approach is less secure** and is **not recommended for production**.
