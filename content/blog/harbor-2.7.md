![Replication by chunk](../img/blog-2.7/replicatin-by-chunk.png)



With the development of edge compute, the image registry such as Harbor be deployed by sink to edge nodes to achieve the better performance and independence. For some use cases, they need to replicate images from one center Harbor(regisgtry) to edge Harbor instance, but usually the network for edge is restrict and even unstable. The `Low Bandwidth` and `High Latency` environment is the big challenge for replication. So we need to support copy over chunk for replication to improve the quality.
