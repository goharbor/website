## Exciting New Features üéâ

### SBOM Generation and Management
Harbor 2.11 introduces robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. This powerful feature enhances transparency and security by allowing users to view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.

For those handling massive concurrent pushes to a project, enabling the `Automatically generate SBOM on push` feature ensures smooth operation. Simply set `core.quotaUpdateProvider: redis` in `values.yaml` for Harbor-helm or `core.quota_update_provider: redis` in `harbor.yml` for Docker-compose installations. This tweak reduces overall resource consumption, optimizing database connections, CPU usage, and memory.

### Integration with VolcEngine Registry
One of the standout features in Harbor 2.11 is the seamless integration with VolcEngine Registry. Users can now effortlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry. This integration enhances interoperability and flexibility, allowing for a more versatile and dynamic Harbor ecosystem.

### HorborÎäî ÌïúÍµ≠ Ïª§ÎÆ§ÎãàÌã∞Î•º ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï©ÎãàÎã§! - Korean UI Translation
In our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, Harbor 2.11 introduces a Korean language translation for the user interface. This update ensures that Korean-speaking users can navigate and utilize Harbor more efficiently, making the platform more user-friendly and globally accessible.

## Enhancements üöÄ

### Skip Transaction for POST /service/token
Performance improvements are always a priority. In Harbor 2.11, a significant enhancement is the ability to skip transactions for POST /service/token requests. Contributed by @liubin in #19339, this update streamlines token service operations, enhancing overall performance.

### Updated Internationalization: French (fr-fr)
Thanks to @tostt in #19915, Harbor's internationalization has been further refined with updates to the French (fr-fr) translations. This continuous improvement ensures that non-English speaking users have a smooth and coherent experience.

### Known Issue
It's worth noting a known issue affecting versions v2.10.x and v2.9.x. When performing pull-based replication from a GitLab registry to Harbor, users must be members of the source project in GitLab, even if it's a public project. This membership requirement is essential to perform the replication successfully.

## Docs update üóÑÔ∏è
* Fix docker version to 20.10.10 by @YangJiao0817 in [19751](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/pull/19751)
